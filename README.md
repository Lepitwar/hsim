Routing Alg. Sim. 
Objectives	
	
The	goal	of	this	simulation	is	to	test	the	performance	and	upfront	cost	(in	terms	of	hop	count)	of	
various	routing	algorithms	in	different	situations	regarding	network	shape	and	size.	The	routing	
algorithms	in	question	are	Link	State	Routing,	Distance	Vector	Routing,	and	Hot	Potato	Routing.		
	
Program	
	
Our	program	is	written	in	C,		to	compile	using	the	makefile,	and	run	with:	
	./esim	filename.txt
